Edit your links page using Markdown syntax.\r\n\r\nFrom within **Xcode Organizer**, get access to:\r\n* Apple Developer links (forums, bug reporter, videos, iTunes Connect)\r\n* Search Google and Stack Overflow\r\n* Add links your own projects\r\n\r\n![YmsDevLinks in Xcode Organizer](http://kickingvegas.github.io/YmsDevLinks/images/ymsdevlinks.jpg)\r\n\r\n**YmsDevLinks** takes advantage of [appledoc](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/) to build and install your links page into Xcode.\r\n\r\n# Requirements\r\n* Xcode 4.6.x\r\n* appledoc\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n1. Install [appledoc](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/)\r\n1. Edit `Makefile` to set the variables `PROJECT_NAME`, `COMPANY`, and `COMPANY_ID` to your preference.\r\n1.
